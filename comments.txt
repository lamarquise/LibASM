# our hello.asm:
# ok so this is one way of running assembly on mac:
nasm -fmacho64 hello.asm && ld -macosx_version_min 10.15 -lSystem hello.o && ./a.out
	# works with global _main but not global start or _start
	# prolly would work if we put it in a libary...



If i directly shove all my functions into a library and compile a main.c with
it i won't have much to worry about...


64.asm works the same way, needs the same shit to compile...

main.s works flawlessly...
	compiles with clang, is a .s

Ok so clang .s works but only for main.s, not with others, not sure why
maybe bad Opcodes? like they aren't availible to clang ?
But in any case, main.s is in the wrong formate or norm, i think...


Use Nasm from now on, it is the expected syntax.


This shit works without the warning, added: -no_pie
nasm -fmacho64 hello.asm && ld -macosx_version_min 10.13 -lSystem -no_pie hello.o && ./a.out
